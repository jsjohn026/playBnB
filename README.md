### Introduction

PlayBnb is a single-page clone of AirBnb. Users can search from a selection of listed homes to stay based on location and the number of guests they are traveling with.

Pages

### Session Modal (Log in or Signup)

Users can view much of the site content without signing up, specifically listing information. They will be asked to log in or sign up once they try to book a listing. The modal allows users to switch between the log in or sign up form with having to load a separate page.
