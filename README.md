### Introduction

PlayBnb is a single-page clone of AirBnb. Users can search from a selection of listed homes to stay based on location and the number of guests they are traveling with.

Pages
----------------------------------------------------

### Session Modal (Log in or Sign up)

Users can view much of the site content without signing up, specifically listing information. They will be asked to log in or sign up once they try to book a listing. The modal allows users to switch between the log in or sign up form with having to load a separate page. 


### Navigation Bar

Users can access multiple pages from one navigation bar located at the top of the page. The options on this bar change once a user is logged in. The navigation bar is accessible as users scroll down the page or go to another link within the application.
